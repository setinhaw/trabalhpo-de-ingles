        While reading "Diary of a Wimpy Kid," I felt amused and entertained. The humorous situations and the character's awkwardness made me laugh.Reading "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" can bring back memories of the awkward and embarrassing moments many people experienced during their adolescent years. It can be embarrassing to relate so much to the drama, and it reminds us of how challenging that phase of life can be.
